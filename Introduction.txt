This project started with the idea of a photonic universe background and then tried to solve the problems of black holes and multi universes step by step. 
Along the way, other particles were added to the model as needed. The next added particles were protons, neutrinos, and axions. 
After the structure of this background, several unexplained phenomena were investigated, such as the Philadelphia Experiment and Yildiz magnetic motor, and several other topics. 
Then, the model of cosmic consciousness was developed (UQCMF).

Most of the material is based on personal ideas and directing artificial intelligence to achieve specific goals.
