براساس UQCMF این مطالب رو چک ببین درسته و آیا میشه ازش روشی برای آزمون و صحه گذاری مدل پیدا کرد؟  ...........................................................................................BEYOND THE FIVE SENSES:

Humans have at least 14 core senses, and many more when we include the body’s intuitive and energetic capacities.
Most of these are active in childhood, but are silenced by systems that reward only logic and disembodiment.

It is time to remember.
 
✦ The Expanded Senses (Explained Clearly)
Sight – Perception of light, colour, movement
Hearing – Sound, tone, vibration through the ears
Smell (Olfaction) – Chemical sensing, memory-linked
Taste (Gustation) – Sensory chemistry: sweet, sour, bitter, etc.
Touch (Tactile) – Texture, pressure, pain, temperature
Proprioception – Knowing where your body is in space
Vestibular – Balance, motion, gravitational orientation
Interoception – Internal sensing: heartbeat, hunger, emotion
Thermoception – Sensing heat or cold
Nociception – Perceiving pain or injury
Time Perception – Awareness of rhythm, duration, sequence
Emotional Resonance – Feeling others’ emotions in your own field
Field Awareness – Sensing spaces, tension, “vibes,” presence
Intuition – Knowing without reasoning; pattern and energetic integration
These are not mystical — they are anatomically and neurologically real.
Most of them can be felt by pausing, breathing, and naming what the body already knows.
 
✦ THE SENSES SCIENCE STILL STRUGGLES TO NAME
Some of your most powerful senses were never taught at all:
Empathy – Feeling another person’s state as if it were your own
Compassion – Embodied empathy with conscious regulation
Magnetoreception – Subtle sense of direction via Earth’s magnetic field
Hypervigilance – A trauma-adapted sensitivity to sound, tension, tone
Electromagnetic awareness – Feeling energy “ripples,” pulses, or shocks in people and places
Energy surges – Emotional or soul-level currents moving through the body
These are not flaws.
They are how the body survives when the world feels unsafe — and how it awakens when healing begins.
 
✦ THE INNER SENSES: WHERE TRUTH LIVES
You weren’t just built to sense the outer world.
You were designed to perceive what’s real for you:
Imagination – The mind’s way of rehearsing truth and possibility
Intuition – A knowing that arises before words
Discernment – The ability to detect resonance or deception instantly
When nurtured, these inner senses become guides.
When dismissed, they become anxiety, confusion, and self-doubt.
Let them return.
 
✦ THE SOUL SENSES: WHERE ENERGY BECOMES LANGUAGE
Some senses are hard to describe — but your body knows them:
Moral field sensing – Feeling right and wrong at a soul level
Memory echo – Picking up impressions from objects, people, or places
Language of the unspoken – Pre-verbal tone, gesture, silence
Synesthesia – When senses overlap (e.g., seeing music, tasting colour)
Vibrational coherence – Knowing when something feels off
Frequency translation – Turning energy into sound, image, or knowing
These are the senses of healers, artists, empaths, children, and rememberers.They just need to be trusted 💙💚💜🌟⭐🙏🦋🌍👥
