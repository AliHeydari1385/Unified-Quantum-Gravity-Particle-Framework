# Unified Quantum Gravity-Particle Framework
A Complete Theory of Fundamental Interactions
This project started with the idea of a photonic universe background and then tried to solve the problems of black holes and multi universes step by step. 
Along the way, other particles were added to the model as needed. The next added particles were protons, neutrinos, and axions. 
After the structure of this background, several unexplained phenomena were investigated, such as the Philadelphia Experiment and Yildiz magnetic motor, and several other topics. 
Then, the model of cosmic consciousness was developed (UQCMF).
